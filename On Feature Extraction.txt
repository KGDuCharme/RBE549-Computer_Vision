The following link sort of outlines the structure:

There seems to be two components in detection. The thing that draws the bounding box, and the actual detector. 
We should probably break it up into these parts. In addition, I think that tracking would be a useful, if not necessary step.
I think tracking is useful so that it keeps track of each image.

DETECTION:
Bounding Boxes:
So far, what I've found is that Single shot multi-box detector is the norm. Haven't dug too deep yet. 
Here is the paper that defines SSD:

Detectors:
So, the thing you found is VGG16, and the thing I found uses resnet. If I understand correctly, yours just uses VGG,
(which the default SSD interpretation uses as well).
Here is the paper for Resnet:

This may be useful in deciding which to pick:

Tracking:
Only thing I've found on object tracking is the opencv stuff I included in sources.
